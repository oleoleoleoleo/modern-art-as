## The Modern Art Artificial Stupidity

### Conception

The modern art artificial stupidity project was built during downtime on the Ironhack Web Development bootcamp.

### How does it work

On load, a random bezier curve is generated automatically.
The code has 6 different functions which will generate shapes/strokes of randomized colors, width and coordinates.
The generate button calls a functions that renders 101 different shapes in a canvas. At the moment the designs are not recoverable. A message will be shown on the console with the number of each functions that were called on the make of that particular design.
The whole generator is written with vanilla JS and doesn't require any additional modules.
The total amount of possible colors is 16.581.375.
The total amount of possible designs is infinity - 3.
